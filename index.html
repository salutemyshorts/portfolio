				My name is Delicia and I currently reside in San Francisco, CA. I have an eclectic work background, but ultimately my first love was (and will always be) medicine. I graduated pre-med with a Molecular and Cellular Biology degree from the University of Illinois-Champaign Urbana. Before I moved to the bay area I was an EMT for many years.
